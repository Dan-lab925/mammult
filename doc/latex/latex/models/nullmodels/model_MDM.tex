\mydescription{This is the Multi-activity Deterministic Model (MDM). 
           In this model each node $i$ is considered active if it was
           active in the reference multiplex, maintains the same value
           of node activity $B_i$ (i.e., the number of layers in which
           it was active) and is associated an activity vector sampled
           uniformly at random from the $M\choose{B_i}$ possible
           activity vectors with $B_i$ non-null entries.

          The file \textit{Bi\_file}  is in the format:
          
          \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Bi N(Bi)}
          
          where \textit{Bi} is a value of node activity
          and \textit{N(Bi)} is the number of nodes which had node
          activity equaly to \textit{Bi} in the reference multiplex.
          
          The parameter \textit{M} is the number of layers in the
          multiplex.

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a distribution of
          bit-strings, in the format:

          \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Bi bitstring count}

          where \textit{bitstring} is the activity
          bitstring, \textit{Bi} is the number of non-zero entries
          of \textit{bitstring} and \textit{count} is the number of
          times that \textit{bitstrings} appear in the null model.}
