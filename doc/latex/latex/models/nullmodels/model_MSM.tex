\mydescription{This is the Multi-activity Stochastic Model (MSM). 
           In this model each node $i$ is considered active if it was
           active in the reference multiplex, and is activated on
           each layer with a probability equal to $B_i/M$ where $B_i$
           was the activity of node $i$ in the reference multiplex.

          The file \textit{node\_Bi\_file}  is in the format:
          
          \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{node\_i Bi)}
          
          where \textit{Bi} is the value of node activity
          of \textit{node\_i} in the reference multiplex.
          
          
          The parameter \textit{M} is the number of layers in the
          multiplex.
}         

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a node-layer list of lines in the
 format:

 \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{node\_i layer\_i}
 
 where \textit{node\_i} is the ID of a node and \textit{layre\_i} is
 the ID of a layer. This list indicates which nodes are active in
 which layer. For instance, the line:

 \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{24 3}

 indicates that the node with ID \textit{24} is active on
 layer \textit{3}.
