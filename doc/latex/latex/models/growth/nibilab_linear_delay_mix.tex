\mydescription{Grow a two-layer multiplex network using the multiplex linear
          preferential attachment model by Nicosia, Bianconi, Latora,
          Barthelemy (NiBiLaB).

          The probability for a newly arrived node $i$ to create a
          link to node $j$ on layer $1$ is:
          
          \begin{equation*}
          \Pi_{i\to j}^{1} \propto ak\lay{1}_j + bk\lay{2}_j
          \end{equation*}

          and the dual probability for $i$ to create a link to $j$ on
          layer $2$ is:

          \begin{equation*}
          \Pi_{i\to j}^{2} \propto ck\lay{1}_j + dk\lay{2}_j
          \end{equation*}
          
          Each new node arrives on one of the two layers, chosen
          uniformly at random, and its replica on the other layer
          appears after a time delay $\tau$ sampled from the power-law
          function:

          \begin{equation*}
            P(\tau) \sim \tau^{-\beta}
          \end{equation*}

          The (mandatory) parameters are as follows:

          \begin{itemize}

          \item \textbf{N} number of nodes in the final graph

          \item \textbf{m} number of new edges brought by each new node

          \item \textbf{m0} number of nodes in the initial seed
                    graph. \textit{m0} must be larger than of equal
                    to \textit{m}.

          \item \textbf{outfile} the name of the file which will contain the            
          
          \item \textbf{a,b,c,d} the coefficients of the attaching probability
          function

          \item \textbf{beta} the exponent of the power-law delay
          function which determines the arrival of replicas on layer $2$

          \end{itemize}
 }


\myreturn{The program dumps on the file \texttt{outfile} the
 (undirected) edge list of the resulting network. Each line of the
 file is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.
