\mydescription{Compute and print on output the probability to have a link between two nodes in layer $1$ given their weight in layer $2$. 
As input are given the files \textit{layer1}, \textit{layer2}, the number of bins for the link weights of the second layer, the minimum and the maximum values of the binning.
  
  The first file contains the binary edge list of layer $1$, the second file contains the weighted edge list of layer $2$. each
  line is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{bin\_min} \textit{bin\_max} \textit{freq}
  
  where \textit{bin\_min} and \textit{bin\_max} are the minimum and maximum values of the link weights of layer $2$ in that binning, and  \textit{freq} is the probability to have a link on layer $1$ given such weight in layer $2$.}

\myreturn{A list of lines, where the n-th line is the minimum and maximum values of the weight of the links in layer $2$ in the n-th bin, and the frequency to have a link on layer $2$ given that weight.}
