          {rank the nodes of a layer whose value of a given structural
          descriptor is above a threshold.}  {$<$prop\_file$>$ $<$thresh$>$}

\mydescription{Get a file as input, whose n-th line corresponds to the value of a
 certain property of the n-th node, and rank the nodes according to
 that property, taking into account ranking ties properly. The rank of
 all the nodes whose value of the structural descriptor is smaller
 than the threshold \textit{thresh} specified as second parameter is
 set to \textbf{0} (ZERO). }

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a list of lines, where
 the n-th line contains the rank of the n-th node corresponding to the
 values of the structural descriptor provided in the input file, or
 zero if such desxriptor is below the specified
 threshold \textit{thresh}.}
