\mydescription{Compute the Pearson's linear correlation coefficient
          between two sets of (either integer- or real-valued) node
          properties provided in the input files \textit{file1}
          and \textit{file2}. Each input file contains a list of
          lines, where the n-th line contains the value of a node
          property for the n-th node.  For instance, \textit{file1}
          and \textit{file2} might contain the degrees of nodes at two
          distinct layers of a multiplex. However, the program is
          pretty general and can be used to compute the Pearson's
          correlation coeffcient between any pairs of node properties.

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} the value of the
          Pearson's linear correlation coefficient between the two
          sets of node properties.
