          {rank the nodes of a layer according to a given structural
          descriptor.}  {$<$prop\_file$>$}

\mydescription{Get a file as input, whose n-th line corresponds to the value of a
 certain property of the n-th node, and rank the nodes according to
 that property, taking into account ranking ties properly.
 
 For example, if \textit{propfile} contains the degrees of the nodes
 at a certain layer of the multiplex, the computes the ranking induced
 by degrees, where the node with the highest degree will be assigned a
 rank equal to \textbf{1} (one).
}

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a list of lines, where
 the n-th line contains the rank of the n-th node corresponding to the
 values of the structural descriptor provided in the input file.}
