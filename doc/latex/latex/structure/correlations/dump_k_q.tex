\mydescription{Compute and dump on \texttt{stdout} the degree
          sequences of two layers of a multiplex. The input
          files \textit{layer1} and \textit{layer2} contain the
          (undirected) edge lists of the two layers, and each line is
          in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.

  The third file \textit{pairing} is a list of lines in the format:

  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{IDL1 IDL2} 

  where \textit{IDL1} is the ID of a node on layer $1$
  and \textit{IDL2} is the ID of the same node on layer $2$. For
  instance, the line:

  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{5 27}

  indicates that node $5$ on layer $1$ has ID $27$ on layer $2$. }


\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} the degree of each
node on the two layers, in the format:

\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{ki qi}

where \textit{ki} is the degree of node \textit{i} on layer $1$
and \textit{qi} is the degree of node \textit{i} on layer $2$.}
