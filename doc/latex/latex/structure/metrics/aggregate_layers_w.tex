\mydescription{Compute and print on output the edge list of the  
               weighted aggregated graph associated to the multiplex
               network given on input. An edge is present in the
               aggregated graph if it exists in at least one of the M
               layers of the multiplex.

  Each input file contains the (undirected) edge list of a layer, and
  each line is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.}

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} the edge list of the
  aggregated graph associated to the multiplex network. The edge list
  is a list of lines in the format:
   

  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{ID1 ID2 weight}

  \noindent where \textit{ID1} and \textit{ID2} are the IDs of the two
  nodes and \textit{weight} is the number of layers in which an edge
  between \textit{ID1} and \textit{ID2} exists.}
