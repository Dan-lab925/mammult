\mydescription{Compute and print on output the sum and the
          corresponding participation coefficient of a generic
          structural descriptor of the nodes of a multiplex.

   \noindent The input file is a generic collection of
   single-space-separated columns, where each line corresponds to a
   node. The user must specify the IDs of the columns which contain
   the node structural descriptors to be used in the cartography
   diagram. Columns IDs start from ZERO. For example:

   \textbf{python cartography\_from\_layers.py filein.txt 0
   2 4 6 8}

   \noindent will create a cartography diagram assuming that the
   multiplex network has five layers, and that the node structural
   descriptors at each layers are contained in the first (0), third
   (2), fifth (4), seventh (6) and nineth (8) columns of each row.}


\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a list of lines in the
  format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{tot\_n P\_n}

  where \textit{tot\_n} is the sum over the layers of the considered
  structural descriptor for node $n$, and \textit{P\_n} is the
  associated participation coefficient
