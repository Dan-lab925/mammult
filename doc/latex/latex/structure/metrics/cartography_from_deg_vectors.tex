\mydescription{Compute and print on output the total degree and the
          multiplex participation coefficient of all the nodes of a
          multiplex network whose list of node degree vectors is
          provided as input. The input file is in the format:

  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{IDn\_deg1 IDn\_deg\_2 ... IDn\_degM}

  \noindent where \textit{IDn\_degX} is the degree of node $n$ at
  layer $X$. The input file can be generated using the
  script \texttt{node\_degree\_vectors.py}.}


\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a list of lines in the
  format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{tot\_deg part\_coeff}  

  \noindent where \textit{tot\_deg} is the total degree of the node
  and \textit{part\_coeff} is the corresponding participation
  coefficient. 
  
  \noindent As usual, node IDs start from zero and proceed
  sequentially, without gaps, so if one of the lines in the input
  files contains just zeros, the program considers the corresponding
  node as being isolated on all the layers, and both its total degree
  and multiplex participation coefficient are set equal to zero. }
