          {compute the intersection graph associated to a

\mydescription{Compute and print on output the edge list of the  
               intersection graph associated to the multiplex network
               given on input, where an edge exists only if it is
               present on \textbf{all} the layers of the multiplex.

  Each input file contains the (undirected) edge list of a layer, and
  each line is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.}

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} the edge list of the
  intersection graph associated to the multiplex network. The edge
  list is a list of lines in the format:
   

  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{ID1 ID2}

  \noindent where \textit{ID1} and \textit{ID2} are the IDs of the two
  nodes.}
