          {compute the edge overlap of all the edges of the
          multiplex.}  
          {$<$layer1$>$ [$<$layer2$>$...]}

\mydescription{Compute and print on output the edge overlap $o_{ij}$ of each
          edge of the multiplex. Given a pair of nodes $(i,j)$ that
          are directly connected on at least one of the $M$ layers,
          the edge overlap $o_{ij}$ is defined as:

          \begin{equation*}
          o_{ij} = \sum_{\alpha}a_{ij}\lay{\alpha}
          \end{equation*}
          
  \noindent i.e., the number of layers on which the edge $(i,j)$
  exists.
  
  
  Each input file contains the (undirected) edge list of a layer, and
  each line is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.}

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a list of lines in the
  format:

  \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{ID\_1 ID\_2 overlap}

  \noindent where \textit{ID\_1} and \textit{ID\_2} are the IDs of the
  end-points of the edge, and \textit{overlap} is the number of layers
  in which the edge exists.}
