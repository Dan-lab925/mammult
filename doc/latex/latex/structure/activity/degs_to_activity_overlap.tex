          {compute the activity and the total (overlapping) degree of
          all the nodes of a multiplex.}
          {$<$degree\_vectors$>$}

\mydescription{Take a file which contains, on the n-th line, the degrees at each
 layer of the n-th node, (e.g., the result of the
 script \texttt{node\_degree\_vectors.py}), in the format:

 \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{noden\_deg\_lay1 noden\_deg\_lay2 ... noden\_deg\_layM}

 \noindent and compute the activity (i.e., the number of layers in
 which a node is not isolated) and the total (overlapping) degree of
 each node.}

\myreturn{The program prints on \texttt{stdout} a list of lines, where
 the n-th line contains the activity and the total degree of the n-th
 nodem in the format:

 \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{noden\_activity noden\_tot\_deg}

 \noindent As usual, the program assumes that node IDs start from zero
  and proceed sequentially, without gaps, i.e., if a node ID is not
  present in any of the layer files given as input, the program
  considers it as being isolated on all the layers.
