\mydescription{Compute and print on output the activity of the layers
  of a multiplex network, where the layers are given as input in the
  files \textit{layer1}, \textit{layer2}, etc.
  
  Each file contains the (undirected) edge list of a layer, and each
  line is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.}

\myreturn{A listof lines, where the n-th line is the value of activity
  of the n-th layer, starting from \textbf{0}.}
