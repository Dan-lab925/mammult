          {compute the activity vectors of all the nodes of a multiplex.}
          {$<$degree\_vectors$>$}

\mydescription{Take a file which contains, on the n-th line, the degrees at each
 layer of the n-th node, (e.g., the result of the
 script \texttt{node\_degree\_vectors.py}), in the format:

 \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{noden\_deg\_lay1 noden\_deg\_lay2 ... noden\_deg\_layM}

 \noindent and compute the corresponding node activity bit-strings,
 where a "1" signals the presence of the node on that layer, while a
 zero indicates its absence.
}

\myreturn{The program returns on \texttt{stdout} a list of lines,
  where the n-th line is the activity bit-string of the n-th
  node. Additionally, the program prints on \texttt{stderr} the
  distribution of all activity bit-strings, in the format:

  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{Bn Bit-string count}

  \noindent Where \textit{B} is the number of ones in the activity
  bit-string (i.e., the node-activity associated to that activity
  bit-string), \textit{Bit-string} is the activity bit-string
  and \textit{count} is the number of times that particular activity
  bit-string appears in the multiplex.}
