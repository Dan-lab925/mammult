\mydescription{Compute and print the stationary distribution of additive, multiplicative and intensive biased walks in a multiplex with $2$ layers.
  Files \textit{layer1}, \textit{layer2}, contain the (undirected) edge list of the two layer, and each
  line is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.

  The file \textit{overlapping network} has also a third column indicating the number of times two nodes are connected across all layers.

 $N$ is the number of nodes, $b_1$ is the first bias exponent (the bias exponent for layer $1$ for additive and multiplicative walks, the bias exponent on the participation coefficient for intensive walks), $b_2$ is the second bias exponent (the bias exponent for layer $1$ for additive and multiplicative walks, the bias exponent on the participation coefficient for intensive walks).} 

\myreturn{N lines. In the n-th line we report the node ID, the stationary distribution of that node for additive walks with exponents $b_1$ and $b_2$, the stationary distribution for multiplicative walks with exponents $b_1$ and $b_2$, the stationary distribution for multiplicative walks with exponents $b_1$ and $b_2$, the values of the bias exponents $b_1$ and $b_2$.}
