\mydescription{Compute and print the entropy rate of an intensive biased walks in a multiplex with $2$ layers and bias parameters $b_p$ and $b_o$.
  Files \textit{layer1}, \textit{layer2}, contain the (undirected) edge list of the two layer, and each
  line is in the format:
  
  \hspace{0.5cm}\textit{src\_ID} \textit{dest\_ID}
  
  where \textit{src\_ID} and \textit{dest\_ID} are the IDs of the two
  endpoints of an edge.

  The file \textit{overlapping network} has also a third column indicating the number of times two nodes are connected across all layers.

 $N$ is the number of nodes, $b_p$ is the biased exponent on the participation coefficient, $b_o$ is the biased exponent on the overlapping degree.} 

\myreturn{One line, reporting the value of the entropy rate $h$ of an intensive biased random walks with $b_p$ and $b_o$ as bias exponents, $b_p$ and $b_o$.}
