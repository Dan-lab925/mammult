==== MAMMULT: Metrics And Models for MULTilayer networks ====

Most of the programs included in this version of the MAMMULT
package are in Python, thus no installation at all is needed.
It is sufficient to copy the .py files in the desired directory
and use them. 

Python code requires the following packages to be installed in 
your system:

 SciPy
 Numpy
 Networkx

All the code should work with any recent version of those packages.


Makefiles are available for all C code in the corresponding 
directories, namely:

  structure/correlations/
  models/correlations/
  models/growth/
  dynamics/ising/
  dynamics/randomwalks/

In order to compile C programs it is sufficient to move to the 
corresponding directory and give the command:

  $ make

which will compile all the executables.
